Well I have news for Christians/conservatives Â– theyÂ ’ re the ones who are deluded ! [ insert stream of vulgar name calling here ] Because God does not exist Â– random chance made the universe with all its order and complexity ! How do I know this ? From Madelyn Murray OÂ ’ Hair ! She said so , she proved how smart she was when she won her Â “ separation of church and stateÂ ” lawsuit in 1963 ! She has garnered so many followers that also happened to have an interest in science , that theyÂ ’ ve managed to take over the scientific community ! How could they be wrong ? How could their current representatives , Dawkins and Harris , be wrong ? They obviously know all things ! Now , who should we believe , the Bible , written and preserved over the entire period of the human ability to write , no matter how many attempts have been made to destroy it , or Dawkins and Harris and their millions of followers in the scientific community ? It doesnÂ ’ t matter what the Bible says , Tiktaalik Roseaea is real ! A small band of atheist explorers said so ! We can look in telescopes and see all the galaxies we want ! We know it took that light hundreds of billions of years to reach us ! No God would have made the universe , and sat around that long waiting for us to be able to see it ! Heh heh , is science unbelievable or what ? Now , if you think we donÂ ’ t know how big those galaxies are , how many stars they contain , how many planets they contain that have life on them , how long it takes their light to get here ( accurate to only a few hundred light years , plus or minus ) , you must be deluded or something ! Just ask us , weÂ ’ ll tell you ! According to Christians , orderly , specified complexity in life and the universe show a mathematical improbability very close to impossibility of random , purposeless origins and existence of reality . ThatÂ ’ s ridiculous Â– all you have to do is note that someone wins the lottery just about every week despite that individuals almost impossible chances - that tells you that evolution HAD to have happened ! Dawkins and Harris clearly say that God does not exist , though some deluded non-atheist scientists say that chance canÂ ’ t fully explain evolution , let alone the origins of life . Dawkins has dreams that spacemen came long ago and sowed the seeds of life on earth then flew away , never to be seen again ! How could he be wrong Â– he knows all things ! ItÂ ’ s amazing how the Bible can give us such obviously sound advise concerning finances , morality , behavior , as well as such accurate predictions about the breakdown of those things , and be so wrong about everything that science tells us about politics , and liberalism [ Obama/Ried ] visual here ] and be so wrong about the age of the earth , or how long it takes light to reach us ! IÂ ’ m sure weÂ ’ ll find out life originated from lifeless matter someday , itÂ ’ s been just around the corner for 150 years now . Never mind that the corner keeps getting further and further away scientifically , weÂ ’ re going to find it really soon ! Look , IÂ ’ m an atheist , and us atheists , we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics ( the origin of life by natural processes ) are the truth . We know there is no God , we will never question that , because we are 100 % certain that Madelyn Murray OÂ ’ Hair was right ! Christians arenÂ ’ t certain about anything Â– they donÂ ’ t know how God originated , or where he is ! They have no clue about all those galaxies like we do ! Clearly , stuff like morals and finances , and written history have no place in our lives in the 21st century , we must live by the words of Dawkins and Harris Â– soon they will be able to cure ALL diseases , make us all live forever , and count more galaxies for us ! So that when there is no more death or sorrow thanks to science , and people like Dawkins , Harris , and Obama are ruling over every aspect of our lives , theyÂ ’ ll inform me that theyÂ ’ re correct , and they 'll have ways of seeing to it that I agree with them . Are Christians ever that logical ? So Christians , who exactly is the deluded one here ?\n",

      "It is commonly claimed by secular scientists that creationism is a Â “ science stopper.Â ” The contention is that to ascribe anything ( e.g. , the origin of living organisms ) to the direct action of God is to cut off all scientific inquiry . This seems such simple common sense that it has been very persuasive . Nevertheless , it is not difficult to show that the argument is fallacious . A number of general points can be made . First , the argument is based on ignorance of all the different ways in which Christian faith can enter into science and of how fruitful these have been . After all , many of the great scientists of the past were committed Christians and many of those were consciously exploring the implications of their Christian faith for science . Second , whereas the direct action of God may cut off one type of explanation , others will remain and may even be enhanced . To say that God created the different kinds of animals and plants certainly cuts off explanation in terms of evolutionary continuity . However , it leaves wide-open scientific investigation of every other pattern of relationship ( ecological , developmental , etc . ) between these kinds . Scientists have been so indoctrinated in the belief that all patterns can only be explained historically in terms of the happenstances of Darwinian evolution that many wouldnÂ ’ t even know how to look for explanations in other terms . Third , there is abundant documentation of the fact that evolutionary naturalism has often stopped scientific research . To take just one example , the evolutionary assumption that certain organs or features are vestigial has often long delayed the ( fruitful ) research into their functions . More specifically , one can appeal to experience and this is where this essay becomes a personal testimony to the scientific fruitfulness of a commitment to creation . During my undergraduate days when my Â “ hereticalÂ ” views became known , my professor ( Otto Lowenstein , Professor of Zoology ) made a point of telling me that no creationist would be allowed to do research in his department ! However , he did allow me to do research . From the pressure that was put on me , I can only assume that it was thought that I could be convinced of the error of my ways . If that was the intention , then it badly backfired . Many a visiting scholar was brought into my laboratory to convince me , from their area of expertise , that evolution was indisputably true . Of course , hardly knowing their field , I never had an answer at the time , but after they had gone I would look up the relevant research and carefully analyze it . I always found that the evolutionist case was much weaker than it had seemed and that alternative creationist interpretations were available which were just as or more convincing . My position was further strengthened by the results of my own research .\n",

Our Father Is Donor 150 `` ( front page , Nov. 20 ) : Given the advance of modern technology , parents have the right to fear that their children will have too many resources at their disposal and will disregard their parents ' guidance and seek it elsewhere . Children should not be allowed to go online and find their half-siblings or biological fathers without parental consent . Children in this position are not capable of making a decision of this magnitude . Their parents have their best interests at heart and should have control over the situation . It could be emotionally damaging to meet a half-sibling or a biological father if they are not ready , and only their parents know for sure . Parents are the people who raise and love their kids , not the people who give birth or donate sperm . Stephanie Singer -- Bloomfield Hills , Mich. , Nov. 21 , 2005 To the Editor : I am saddened that your Nov. 20 front-page article used the term `` father `` to refer to a sperm donor . '' Fathers `` are parents who raise children . They change diapers , go to soccer practice , supervise first dates . '' Fathers `` are members of a family , not anonymous sperm donors . There are millions of healthy parents raising children across our country . These parents may not be a traditional `` father `` and `` mother. `` They may be grandparents , single parents , gay parents , family friends , couples who adopt . How often will they be condemned for their absence of `` father `` ? When can we celebrate the reality of these successful , healthy , happy families without holding on to the false myth of the American family ? Alyson D. Miller -- Portland , Ore. , Nov. 20 , 2005 To the Editor : As your Nov. 20 front-page article points out , many sperm banks have not kept records of conceptions . But this is changing . Most sperm banks today not only keep records of conceptions and births , but also limit the number of families created by one donor . The article leaves the impression that all donor insemination offspring have little or no information about their donors and limited opportunity to connect with other donor families . In fact , since the early 1980 's , there has been a movement toward providing more information about donors to their offspring . The Sperm Bank of California pioneered a program in 1983 that allows adult offspring access to their donor 's identity . In 1997 , we started a family contact service to allow families who used the same donor to have contact with one another . In recent years , an increasing number of sperm banks have developed similar programs . The conventional wisdom is that most men would donate sperm only anonymously . But in the past two years , 75 percent of donors at our bank have chosen to participate in our identity program .

      "Dying Lesbian 's Partner Denied Access To Her by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff Posted : February 22 , 2008 - 1:00 pm ET ( Miami , Florida ) Janice Langbehn and Lisa Pond had planned to take their three children on a family cruise . The Olympia , Washington couple had been together 18 years and with their children were looking forward to the holiday . But just as they were about to depart on the cruise from Miami , Florida . Pond , a healthy 39-year-old , suddenly collapsed . She was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami with Langbehn and the children following close behind . But once Langbehn and the children arrived at the hospital the hospital refused to accept information from her about PondsÂ ’ s medical history . Langbehn says she was informed that she was in an antigay city and state , and she could expect to receive no information or acknowledgment as family . A doctor finally spoke with Janice telling her that there was no chance of recovery . Other than one five minute visit , which was orchestrated by a Catholic priest at LangbehnÂ ’ s request to perform last rites , and despite the doctorÂ ’ s acknowledgement that no medical reason existed to prevent visitation , neither she nor her children were allowed to see Pond until nearly eight hours after their arrival . Soon after Pond ' Â ’ s death , Langbehn tried to get her death certificate in order to get life insurance and Social Security benefits for their children . She was denied both by the State of Florida and the Dade County Medical Examiner . http : //www.365gay.com/Newscon08/02/022208fla.htm Note the above . She was informed she was in an `` anti-gay state `` ... 1 ) As I have pointed out before , some of the `` anti-gay marriage `` amendments go well and beyond just `` no gay marriage `` to antagonizing gays by stating in law that gays can not perform certain legal functions , regardless of whether or not it is called `` marriage `` . 2 ) Does anybody have any real doubt that if the two ladies had just walked in as `` friends `` , that this problem would not have happened ? 3 ) I think this furthers my point regarding how some people 's actions and statements FURTHER anti-gay bullying , and that refusing to acknowledge this relationship , or `` blame `` , is futile .
